# Jaleco Chameleon for MiSTerFPGA

A game from Jaleco procuded in 1983. This is a beta port for MiSTerFPGA by Pierco. I did it for fun on my phone during my vacations.

## Tasks for a stable release

- fix video timings: image appears on the right on CRT screens! I added a H-Pos setting in OSD.
- fix joysticks, they are weird for now, a better mapping is possible
